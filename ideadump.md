# 🧠 Close Macro – Idea Dump
## 05-11
HIGH IQ: SEE WHEN MACRO LOW/HIGH TENDS TO FORM BASED ON MACRO CONDITIONS -> EG. PREDICTED EXPANSION MACRO, WHEN DOES LOW FORM?
What I want to test with this, is if we predict an expansion macro, will the low of total_3pm form pre-macro?

## 07-11
Want to investigate how often the macro breaks out of the 3pm range.
Also worthwhile investigating how often macro sets both the high and low of 3pm.

## 08-11
Idea:
Want to see how often different intra-macro profiles occur
Eg. classic expansion macro, low @ 3:50, high @ 3:59
Reversal macro, low @ 3:54-56, high @ 3:59

## 09-11
Idea:
Want to see if smt during 3pm skews the macro direction. For simplicity sake I think I'll just use 5m smts, although that won't be entirely accurate to my trading, should be good enough
For example, does SMT + other factors confirm macro direction more strongly than if there was no smt?
